					<h2>Brewpoint Coffee - Expansion Proposal to Elmhurst City Council</h2>
					<p>Towards the end of 2016, Brewpoint Coffee was looking to expand from one retail location to 2 retail locations and a roasting space in Elmhurst Illinois. We were looking to work with the City of Elmhurst financially to take care of two buildout issues; the closing up of a sidewalk entrance and the beautification of the main, public facing facade. <br /><br /> It was my duty to first come up with the strategy of how to approach the city and then create the presentation and answer any and all financial issues. The presentation turned into the first financial collaboration between the City of Elmhurst and a private organization. The City of Elmhurst agreed to allocate the funds to complete the closing up of the sidewalk and improve the appearance of the main, public facing portion of the building.</p>

					<h2>Brewpoint Coffee - Financial Communication to Brewpoint Leadership Team</h2>
					<p>The vision and mission of Brewpoint include a notion of transparency across all business operations. Therefore I deemed it necessary to inform the leadership team (consisting of the two owners, the operations manager, the coffee quality manager, and the financial manager) of our financial performance. <br /><br /> My duties, therefore, were to produce and present a presentation showing our performance financially year to year and month to month. I believed this presentation should also show how we performed according to the budget I initiated.</p>

					<h2>Brewpoint Coffee - Financial Growth Plan to Potential Investors/Goldman Sachs</h2>
					<p> Throughout the fall/winter of 2016 Brewpoint Coffee was involved in a small business program called Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses. This program works with small businesses to better their business operations by giving them the knowledge of a large international bank such as Goldman Sachs.<br /><br />Through this program, it was my duty to produce the final document stating the growth plan for the expansion of the business. Outside of the program, this plan has been used to communicate who Brewpoint is and what the growth of the business will look like to potential investors.</p>
